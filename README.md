# TodoListACS

This todo list application is based on the Sample.Todo example app that is available for import from Titanium Studio. The app has been reworked to integrate ACS for user tracking and persistence of data across devices.

## Importing

When importing this application you will need to copy tiapp.example.xml to tiapp.xml and enable ACS usage in order to generate your own keys for communicating with cloud services.
